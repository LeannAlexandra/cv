        <H2>I am actively learning</H2>
        <p>I like to learn new things. I always knew about HTML and CSS and Javascript, but never got into web
            development before. Right now, this page is is what I am building as a part of my learning journey on <A
                href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">Udemy</A> I reconfigured my life in 2023
            to pick up skills I always knew I wanted to do, but never
            had any real world application for. <B>I am doing this.</B>. </p>

        <H2>Currently on my plate - mmhmm delicious &#128523 </H2>
        <p>I am actively seeking to improve myself and my understanding of the full stack developer's role and core
            competences. Althought I have previously done some "backyard mechmaniac" projects, that would only put me to
            shame, I have decided in 2022 to go back and relearn a couple of things. Here is what I am currently
            learning in 2023: </p>

        <p>Although just having a certificate of completion from Udemy may seem impressive, I assure you I'd
            rather leave my 'current learning' as is than rush through without doing all of the projects, spending
            enough time to learn all the ins and outs of the subject matter and then focus on what interest me the most.
            Usually I like to learn the things that I require for other projects. For example I did a temporary remote
            internship with a UK based gaming company, sadly I had to resign as my then career demanded to much time of
            me. This prompted me into rethinking what I really want from life and I gave notice and started shifting my
            focus to learning.</p>
